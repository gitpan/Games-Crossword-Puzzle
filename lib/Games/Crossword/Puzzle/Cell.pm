=head1 NAME

Games::Crossword::Puzzle::Cell - one of those little square bits with a number

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $cell = Games::Crossword::Puzzle::Cell->new(\%arg);

You probably don't mean to use this directly.

Valid arguments are:

  across - the across clue
  down   - the down clue
  number - the cell's number
  value  - the value that belongs in the cell
  guess  - the value that a user has put into the cell

In the future, this may return a singleton for The Black Cell.

=head2 across

=head2 down

These methods return the clues for the word beginning in this cell, if any.

=head2 number

This method returns the cell's number, if it is numbered.

=head2 value

This returns the value that should appear in the cell.  It returns undef for
black cells.  Note that this may be more than one character, in case of a
rebus.

=head2 guess

This returns the value that has been filled into the cell by the user.  It
returns undef for black or empty cells.
